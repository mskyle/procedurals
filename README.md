procedurals
===========

Looking for a great idea to pitch to your favorite TV network? Look no further! Build yer own network procedural can help! Well, probably not really.

Want to help make this even better? Fork it and add more job ideas, quirk ideas, or location ideas! I can't promise I'll accept them though because I have a kind of picky sense of humor. But not that picky!
